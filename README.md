## 🧠 Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in any data science workflow.  
In this project, we perform **univariate analysis** to:

- Understand individual feature distributions  
- Identify missing values  
- Detect outliers  
- Summarize key statistics  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

The project is implemented in **Python** using the following libraries:

- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  

---

## 📊 Analysis Performed

- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, variance, etc.)
- Distribution plots (histograms, KDE plots)
- Box plots for outlier detection
- Missing value analysis
